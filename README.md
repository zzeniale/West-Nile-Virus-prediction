West Nile virus (WNV) is the leading mosquito-borne disease in the United States ([CDC, 2009](https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/index.html)). It is a single-stranded RNA virus from the family Flaviviridae, which also contains the Zika, dengue, and yellow fever virus. It is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes (mainly <i>Culex</i> spp.), which become infected when they feed on birds, WNV's primary hosts. Infected mosquitos then spread WNV to people and another animals by biting them. Cases of WNV occur during mosquito season, which starts in the summer and continues through fall ([CDC, 2009](https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/index.html)). 

While WNV is not extremely virulent and only about 1 in 5 people who are infected develop West Nile fever and other symptoms, about 1 out of every 150 infected develop a serious and sometimes fatal illness ([CDC, 2009](https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/index.html)). There is currently no vaccine against WNV.

In view of the recent outbreak of WNV in Chicago, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) has set up a surveillance and control system to trap mosquitos and test for the presence of WNV. The goal of this project is to use these surveillance data to predict the occurrence of WNV given time, location, and mosquito species. Findings from this project will guide and inform decisions on where and when to deploy pesticides throughout the city, to maximise pesticide effectiveness and minimise spending.
